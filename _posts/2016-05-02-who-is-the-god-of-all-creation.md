## Who is the God of all creation?

The Bible calls Our Creator a father, a husband, and a friend. That is the relationship that the Most High God A person identified through the relationship between us. To describe The Creator as a person is an invitation to a relationship with the spirit of God that reveals itself as a savior, a loving friend to those he chooses and to those that choose him. A friend that so loves mankind, people made to belong close to him, that He would die for them to live. Then comes a knowing within the depths of everything in you. Just like the wind blows and you know it. Through myriads of translations, The Creator still inspires through this Holy Bible. It is a living book. A book for the salvation of mankind. The very essence of what makes us people is also essential to the God that made us.

Is this not our life to live? Yet there is death, and decay, and suffering, and greed, and envy. The world is spiraling away from what is pure and good and true and infinite. Whether it tastes good or not, it's all poison. Evil will be so effective that even the very elect of God would be deceived.
