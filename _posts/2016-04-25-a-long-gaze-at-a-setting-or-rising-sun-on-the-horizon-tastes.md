description: "A long gaze at a setting or rising sun on the horizon tastes like hope. It tastes like hope for tomorrow, like hope for more than the eyes can see, like hope for eternity. Hope for a chance to have and hold on to what is beautiful and what is peaceful. It is an awesome yet delicate gorgeous peace that somehow makes me feel at home. I get a sense of belonging. A feeling in a deep part of me. A part of me so deep it feels like a secret place hidden from the rest of my life. I end up in that secret place when I'm swept up in a wind of pure goodness. Like I'm transported by the sight and taste and touch and sound and smell of things that are without-a-doubt-good. And when I get there, it feels like I belong there. Like that hidden place is everywhere I should be."

# Destined to hope

A long gaze at a setting or rising sun on the horizon tastes like hope. It tastes like hope for tomorrow, like hope for more than the eyes can see, like hope for eternity. Hope for a chance to have and hold on to what is beautiful and what is peaceful. It is an awesome yet delicate gorgeous peace that somehow makes me feel at home. I get a sense of belonging. A feeling in a deep part of me. A part of me so deep it feels like a secret place hidden from the rest of my life. I end up in that secret place when I'm swept up in a wind of pure goodness. Like I'm transported by the sight and taste and touch and sound and smell of things that are without-a-doubt-good. And when I get there, it feels like I belong there. Like that hidden place is everywhere I should be.

I pray to know the path to that place and build a house there. And I pray for the means to bring masses of people with me.
